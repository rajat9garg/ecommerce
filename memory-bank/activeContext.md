**Status**: [ACTIVE]

## Current Focus
- [x] Initialize project documentation and memory bank
- [x] Set up Kotlin/Spring Boot project structure
- [ ] Implement user service with JWT authentication
- [ ] Develop product catalog service
- [ ] Implement shopping cart service with Redis persistence
- [ ] Build order processing with concurrency control
- [ ] Configure CI/CD pipeline

## Recent Changes
- 2025-05-24: Configured OpenAPI 3.0 code generation with Spring Boot 3.4.5
- 2025-05-24: Set up JOOQ for type-safe SQL queries
- 2025-05-24: Implemented Flyway database migrations
- 2025-05-24: Integrated Redis for caching and session management
- 2025-05-24: Implemented health check endpoint
- 2025-05-23: Updated project vision and technical brief
- 2025-05-23: Defined system architecture and data models

## Next Steps
1. Implement user registration and JWT authentication
2. Set up service layer for user management
3. Develop product catalog management
4. Build shopping cart functionality with Redis
5. Configure CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions
6. Implement integration tests with Testcontainers
7. Set up monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana

## Blockers
- Need to finalize JWT authentication implementation
- Pending decision on API versioning strategy
- Need to set up CI/CD pipeline with proper test coverage

## Technical Decisions Made
1. **Framework**: Spring Boot 3.4.5 with Kotlin 1.9.25
2. **API Documentation**: OpenAPI 3.0 with code generation
3. **Database**: 
   - PostgreSQL 15 with Flyway migrations
   - JOOQ for type-safe SQL queries
4. **Caching & Session**: Redis 7.0 with Lettuce client
5. **Build System**: Gradle with Kotlin DSL
6. **Testing**: JUnit 5, MockK, and Testcontainers
7. **Containerization**: Docker with multi-stage builds

## Open Questions
1. What are the specific SLAs for API response times?
2. Should we implement API versioning from the start?
3. What are the security requirements for JWT token handling?
4. Do we need to implement distributed tracing?
5. What are the backup and recovery requirements for production?
